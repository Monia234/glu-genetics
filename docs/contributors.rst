GLU is primarily developed and maintained by Kevin Jacobs <jacobs at
bioinformed dot com> to support the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility
(CGEMS_) project, an initiative by the National Cancer Institute (NCI_)
Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG_) and run by the NCI Core
Genotyping Facility (CGF_) to identify genetic alterations that affect
susceptible to prostate and breast cancer.

CGEMS is funded by NCI under Contract N01-CO-12400 by SAIC-Frederick_, a
subsidiary of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC_).
