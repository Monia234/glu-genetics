About these documents
=====================

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by *Sphinx*, a document
processor specifically written for the Python programming language.  GLU has
borrowed this excellent system, which is largely responsible for the high
quality of the presentation.

Many thanks go to:

* the `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for
  creating reStructuredText and the docutils suite
* Georg Brandl for creating Sphinx
