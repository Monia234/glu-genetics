Welcome to GLU's documentation!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GLU is a suite of tools for statistical geneticists, epidemiologists,
statisticicians and analysis working with large sets of Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) in order to find associations between specific variants
and specific phenotypes.

GLU provides tools to:

  * manage of SNP genotype data sets (designed to scale to 10 billion
    genotypes and beyond...)

  * many methods to verify genotype data quality

  * tests for association between SNP markers and continuous or discrete trait
    phenotypes.
