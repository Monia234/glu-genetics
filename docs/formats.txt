GLU recognizes several tab-delimited ASCII file formats for specifying
genotypes and other data used in GLU operations.

Summary
=======

- Genotype data (text format):

 * **trip:** text file containing a single sample, locus, and genotype per line
 * **ldat:** text file containing a matrix of genotypes with a locus per row and a sample per column
 * **sdat:** text file containing a matrix of genotypes with a sample per row and a locus per column
 * **hapmap:** text file of HapMap data, format is same as LDAT

- Genotype data (compressed binary format):

 * **tbat:** binary file containing a single sample, locus, and genotype per line
 * **lbat:** binary file containing a matrix of genotypes with a locus per row and a sample per column
 * **sbat:** binary file containing a matrix of genotypes with a sample per row and a locus per column

- Other data:

 * **list file:** file containing a list of values in a single column

 * **map file:** file containing two columns of values, used to indicate a
                 mapping from the value in one column to the value in the
                 other column

 * **counts file:** file containing genotype counts (homozygous major
                    allele, heterozygous, homozygous minor allele), by locus
                    or by sample - used in the hwp, maf, and hets modules.


Genotype data file format details
=================================

- **TRIP format:**

  The GLU TRIP (genotriple) format is a tab-delimited ASCII format with
  exactly three columns of data and one row (line) of data per genotype to
  be stored.  Rows may appear in any order and no header line is allowed.

 Columns:

  1. Sample name: User specified sample name with no length limit or format restriction.
  2. Locus name : User specified locus name with no length limit or format restriction.
  3. Genotype   : A two character genotype with alleles ' ACGT'.  Genotypes
                  containing one blank are treated as hemizygous, while genotpes composed of
                  an empty string or two blanks are treated as missing.

 Example::

  S1	rs12345	AA
  S2	rs54321	GG
  S3	rs12345	AT	
  S1	rs54321	AG

 *Note: TBAT format is the compressed binary version of TRIP format.*


- **LDAT format:**

  The GLU LDAT (locus text) format is a tab-delimited ASCII format that
  contains a matrix of genotypes with a locus per row and a sample per
  column:

  Row 1: 'ldat' in the first column, each sample name in subsequent columns
  Row 2: locus name in the first column, genotypes for that locus for each sample in the subsequent columns

  Column 1: 'ldat' in the first row, each locus name in subsequent rows
  Column 2: sample name in the first row, genotypes for that sample for each locus in subsequent rows

  Genotypes are coded as a two character string with alleles ' ACGT'.
  Genotypes containing one blank are treated as hemizygous, while genotypes
  composed of an empty string or two blanks are treated as missing.

  Example::

   ldat 	S1	S2	S3
   rs123	AA	AT	
   rs321	AG	GG	AA
   rs555	CC	CC	CC

  *Note: LBAT format is the compressed binary version of LDAT format.*


- **SDAT format:**

  The GLU SDAT (sample text) format is a tab-delimited ASCII format that
  contains a matrix of genotypes with a sample per row and a locus per
  column.

  Row 1: 'sdat' in the first column, each locus name in subsequent columns
  Row 2: sample name in the first column, genotypes for that sanple for each locus in the subsequent columns

  Column 1: 'sdat' in the first row, each sample name in subsequent rows
  Column 2: locus name in the first row, genotypes for that locus for each sample in subsequent rows

  Genotypes are coded as a two character string with alleles ' ACGT'.
  Genotypes containing one blank are treated as hemizygous, while genotpes
  composed of an empty string or two blanks are treated as missing.

  Example::

   sdat	rs123	rs321	rs555
   S1	AA	AG	CC
   S2	AT	GG	CC
   S3	  	AA	CC


  *Note: SBAT format is the compressed binary version of SDAT format.*

  filters items, renames samples and loci, merges data files, and performs
  many other useful functions.
