  allele
    Any one of a number of viable DNA codings occupying a given locus (position) on a chromosome

  Case-control study
    A study including subjects who already have a condition, and those who
    don't have the condition, to determine if there are characteristics of
    the affected subjects that differ from the unaffected subjects

  CGEMS
    Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility

  completion rate
    For a set of genotype data (either by SNP or for a single individual),
    the percentage of genotypes completed successfuly compared to genotypes
    attempted

  dbSNP identifier
    The identifier for a cluster of polymorphisms in dbSNP, NCBI.s central
    repository for single base nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) and short
    deletion and insertion polymorphisms (aka 'rs number') - see
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP

  genome
    The complete sequence of DNA contained in an organism or a cell,
    including both the chromosomes within the nucleus and the DNA in
    mitochondria

  Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
    An approach that involves rapidly scanning markers across a person's
    genome to find SNPs associated with a particular condition

  genomic location
    The physical location of a feature (e.g. gene, exon, SNP) on a genome or chromosome

  genotype
    The genetic makeup encoded in an individual's DNA. When related to SNPs,
    the genotype refers to the nucleotides at the SNP locus on the two DNA
    strands of the sample.

  Hardy Weinberg equilibrium
    Hardy and Weinberg's principle states that, under certain
    conditions, after one generation of random mating, the genotype
    frequencies at a single gene locus will become fixed at a particular
    equilibrium values. It also specifies that those equilibrium frequencies
    can be represented as a simple function of the allele frequencies at
    that locus.

  HUGO gene symbol
    A gene symbol approved by and included in the HGNC (HUGO Gene
    Nomenclature Committee database) - see http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature

  minor allele frequency
    The frequency of chromosomes in the population carrying the less common variant of SNP

  NCBI
    National Center for Biotechnology Information, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

  NCICB
    National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics, see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/

  p-value
    In the case of SNP disease association studies, a statistical measure of
    evidence that the SNP is associated with the disease phenotype

  SNP
    Single nucleotide polymorphism: A SNP occurs when corresponding
    sequences of DNA from different individuals differ at one DNA base; for
    example, where the sequence AAGCCTA changes to AAGCTTA.

  SNP panel
    A collection of SNP loci genotyped together on a genotyping platform
    (e.g. Illumina)

  whole genome rank
    The rank of significance (disease phenotype association) of the specific
    SNP in the analysis (the lower the rank, the higher the significance)
