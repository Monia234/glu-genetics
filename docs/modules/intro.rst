Welcome to GLU
==============

Genotype Library and Utilities (GLU) is a suite of tools for statistical
geneticists, epidemiologists, statisticicians and analysis working with
large sets of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in order to find
associations between specific variants and specific phenotypes.

GLU provides tools to:

* manage of SNP genotype data sets (designed to scale to 10 billion
  genotypes and beyond...)

* many methods to verify genotype data quality

* tests for association between SNP markers and continuous or discrete trait
  phenotypes.

More information is available by running the following modules:

 * **intro.overview** : more detailed overview of GLU
 * **intro.formats** : basic information on GLU file formats
 * **intro.quickstart** : just the basics for how to get started
 * **list** : list major modules
