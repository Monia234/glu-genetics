.. module:: concordance
   :synopsis: Check concordance of two sets of genotypes

The :mod:`qc.concordance` module can calculate concordance by sample or by
locus, and between research data sets or between one research data set and a
reference data set. Where allele mapping is unknown (i.e. positive or
negative strand), the allele mapping can be identified by finding the
greatest concordance resulting from different mappings.
