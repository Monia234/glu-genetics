Major changes since GLU 0.54
============================

* Binary file support has been added.  All modules can read and write highly
  compressed binary files using the lbat, sbat, and tbat format names and
  file extensions.  These correspond to the text file formats ldat, sdat,
  and trip, respectively.

  The advantages of these binary files include:

  * loading genotype data is up to 20x faster
  * saving genotype data is up to 10x faster
  * genotype file size is significantly reduced, often by more than 2x over
    a compressed text version

* The in-memory representation of genotypes

* A lot of other good things.
