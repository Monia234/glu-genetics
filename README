Welcome to GLU: The Genotype Library and Utilities.

GLU provides command-line tools for the management of large amounts of SNP
genotype data and programs to check its quality and to test for association
between SNP markers with continuous or discrete trait phenotypes.

This will be an informative, witty, and insightful README file at some
point.  In the mean time, please excuse the current humble incarnation.


Installation the easy way
-------------------------

Major GLU releases will be available in the form of binary installation
packages for the following operating systems:

	Microsoft Windows XP/Vista 32bit Intel MSI installer
	Microsoft Windows XP/Vista 32bit AMD   MSI installer
	Fedora Linux 7             64bit Intel RPM installer, egg file
	Fedora Linux 7             64bit AMD   RPM installer, egg file
	Apple OS X 10.4.6 (Tiger)        Intel egg file

Additional platforms can be added by request, although limited by my access
to suitable systems.  Contributed binary versions for additional platforms
are greatfully accepted, though only from contributors who are willing to
track and provide builds for major releases in a timely fashion.


Installtion from source
-----------------------

For most, a binary installation of GLU will be the preferred method of
installtion.  However, power-users and software developers who which to
extend or modify GLU will want to consider installing from source. GLU is
easily built from source on Unix-like systems, but requires several
pre-requistite packages to be installed and access to Fortran and C
compilers.

Prerequistites for using GLU:

GLU requires the following free and open source packages:

	Python   2.5.1 or newer from http://www.python.org/
	NumPy    1.0.3 or newer from http://numpy.scipy.org/
	SciPy    0.5.3 or newer from http://www.scipy.org/
	PyTables 2.0   or newer from http://www.pytables.org/
        SQLite   2.4.1 or newer from http://www.sqlite.org/

Prerequistites of the prerequistites:

	NumPy and SciPy require a full version of BLAS and LAPACK libraries
	for many numerical functions.  As these are performance-critical,
	optimized versions have been developed, including:
	
	MKL  by Intel Corp from http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/307757.htm
	ACML by   AMD Corp from http://developer.amd.com/acml.jsp
	ATLAS+LAPACK       from http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/

	In addition, PyTables is based on the HDF5 standard and requires:

	HDF5 1.6.5 or newer from http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

Then to build install GLU, run:

	python setup.py install

To run GLU:

	glu -h
	glu <module>

To get started:

	glu intro

Please contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, or want to
contribute better documentation.
