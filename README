Welcome to GLU: The Genotype Library and Utilities.

GLU provides tools for the management of large amounts of SNP genotype data
and programs to check its quality and to test for association between SNP
markers with continuous or discrete trait phenotypes.

This will be an informative, witty, and insightful README file at some
point.

In the mean time, to install GLU, run:

	python setup.py install

To run GLU:

	glu -h
	glu <module>

To get started:

	glu intro

Please contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, or want to
contribute better documentation.
