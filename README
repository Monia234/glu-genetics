Welcome to GLU: Genotype Library and Utilities

GLU provides command-line tools for the management of large amounts of SNP
genotype data and programs to check its quality and to test for association
between SNP markers with continuous or discrete trait phenotypes.

This will be an informative, witty, and insightful README file at some
point.  In the mean time, please excuse the current humble incarnation.

Windows may be downloaded from:

To subscribe to the GLU Developers group, visit:

It is highly recommended that interested users and developers join one or
both of these groups, since this is where most of the GLU-related discussion
will take place and where help may be obtained.  You can join from the links
at the bottom or right side of the GLU project page.

  * You will need to create a Google Account, which is painless and does not
    require a GMail account.

    - If you do have a GMail account and want email from the group to be
      sent to another address, then please sign off from GMail before
      attempting to join either group.

    - Otherwise, if you are logged into GMail your group subscription may
      default to your GMail account.

  * Click "Create an account now"

  * Enter your email address (e.g. you@mail.nih.gov), enter a new and unique
    password, and the other information they request.
