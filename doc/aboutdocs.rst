About these documents
=====================

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, a document processor originally written for
the Python programming language.  GLU has borrowed this excellent system,
which is largely responsible for the high quality of the presentation.

Many thanks go to:

* the `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for creating
  `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ and the docutils
  suite
* Georg Brandl for creating `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
