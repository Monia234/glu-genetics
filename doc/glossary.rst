  allele
    Any one of a number of viable DNA coding variants occupying a given
    locus (position) on a chromosome.

  autosome
    An autosome is chromosome with ploidy that does not depend on the sex of
    the organism. Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes. The X and Y chromosomes
    are not autosomal.  Non-autosomal chromosomes are usually referred to as
    sex-linked chromosomes, allosomes or heterosomes.

  biallelic
    A locus with two alleles

  Case-control study
    A study including subjects who already have a condition, and those who
    don't have the condition, to determine if there are characteristics of
    the affected subjects that differ from the unaffected subjects.

  CGEMS
    Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility

  completion rate
    For a set of genotype data (either by SNP or for a single individual),
    the percentage of genotypes completed successfully compared to genotypes
    attempted.

  dbSNP identifier
    The identifier for a cluster of polymorphisms in dbSNP, NCBI's central
    repository for single base nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) and short
    deletion and insertion polymorphisms (aka 'rs number') - see
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP.

  genome
    The complete sequence of DNA contained in an organism or a cell,
    including both the chromosomes within the nucleus and the DNA in
    mitochondria.

  Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
    An approach that involves rapidly scanning markers across a person's
    genome to find SNPs associated with a particular condition.

  genomic location
    The physical location of a feature (e.g. gene, exon, SNP) on a genome or
    chromosome.

  genotype
    The genotype is the genetic constitution of a cell, an organism, or an
    individual.  When related to SNPs, a genotype refers to the alleles at a
    location in the genome (locus).  Humans usually have have two alleles at
    autosomal (non-sex linked) loci, and only one allele at loci in
    non-autosomal chromosomes or mitocondrial DNA.  on the two chromosomes
    of a diploid individual.

  Hardy Weinberg proportions (HWP)
    Hardy and Weinberg's principle genotypes for diploid organisms (like
    humans) are composed of two alleles, each independently chosen.  Due to
    this independence property, the probability of a phased genotypes is
    the product of the probabilities of each allele.  The frequency of
    genotypes at a locus that occur in Hardy Weinberg proportions can be
    predicted given the frequency of each allele.  Loci may deviate from HWP
    for many reasons, including non-random mating (inbreeding, assortative
    mating, finite population size), selection, mutation, and problematic
    genotype assays.

  Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
    A locus that maintains the same genotype frequencies at a locus in Hardy
    Weinberg Proportions across multiple generations.  Under certain
    conditions, after one generation of random mating, the genotype
    frequencies at a locus will become fixed in HWP.

  HUGO gene symbol
    A gene symbol approved by and included in the HGNC (HUGO Gene
    Nomenclature Committee database) - see http://www.genenames.org/

  locus or loci

  minor allele frequency (MAF)
    The frequency of chromosomes in the population carrying the less common
    variant of a biallelic SNP.

  p-value
    In statistical hypothesis testing, the p-value is the probability of
    obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one that was actually
    observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.  In the case of SNP
    disease association studies, a statistical measure of evidence that the
    SNP is associated with the disease phenotype.

  ploidy
    Ploidy is the number of homologous sets of chromosomes in a biological
    cell. In humans, most cells are diploid (containing one set of
    chromosomes from each parent), but sex cells (sperm and egg) are
    haploid. In contrast, tetraploidy (four sets of chromosomes) is a type
    of polyploidy and is common in plants, and not uncommon in amphibians,
    reptiles, and various species of insects.

  SNP
    Single nucleotide polymorphism: A SNP occurs when corresponding
    sequences of DNA from different individuals differ at one DNA base; for
    example, where the sequence AAGC**C**TA changes to AAGC**T**TA.

  SNP array or panel
    A collection of SNP loci assayed together on a genotyping platform
    (e.g. Illumina)

  whole genome rank
    The rank of significance (disease phenotype association) of the specific
    SNP in the analysis (the lower the rank, the higher the significance)
